# Temperature Converter (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
This is a small beginner project created as part of my journey learning Python.
The program is a simple console-based temperature converter that converts values between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
I am a Python student, and I build small projects like this to practice core programming concepts and improve my understanding step by step.

## 🔧 How It Works
The user enters a temperature unit (C or F)
Then the user inputs a temperature value

## The program converts:
Celsius → Fahrenheit
Fahrenheit → Celsius
